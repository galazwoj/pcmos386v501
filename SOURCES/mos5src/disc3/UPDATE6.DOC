                  Update #6 enhancements and updates


The following describes updates to PC-MOS 5.01 prior to Booster
Version 1.00.  All enhancements and updates through and including
Update #6 are described.


  1. An updated Auto Configuration Utility ACU.EXE that has been
     modified to make sure that the UPDAT501.SYS device driver
     statement is included in your CONFIG.SYS file.

  2. A new FORMAT.COM that will not run when booted under DOS 5.0. 
     The master boot record could be overwritten if you used
     FORMAT.COM to format a MOS secondary partition when running under
     DOS 5.0.  FORMAT.COM will now only run when booted under PC-MOS.

  3. A program called SFT.COM that must be run BEFORE you try to
     install FOXPRO on your system.  SFT.COM is a TSR program that
     allows FOXPRO's install program to "see" the setting it requires
     for FILES= so that it will function properly.

  4. Updated EmuLink terminal device drivers ELTERM.SYS and HGTERM.SYS
     that contain a correction for printing at the terminal using the
     MOS ROUTE LPTn TO TERM command.  When printing from an
     application that caused the screen to scroll during the print,
     extra characters would be sent to the printer.  Also, these
     drivers make sure that caps lock, num lock, and scroll lock work
     correctly at the terminal.  In order for this second correction
     to work properly, the patch E31_P2.PAT must be manually applied
     to EmuLink 3.1.

  5. The patch E31_P2.PAT that must be manually applied to EmuLink 3.1
     to ensure that caps lock, num lock, and scroll lock work
     correctly at the EmuLink terminal.  Instructions on how to apply
     the patch are in the patch file itself.  Use the TYPE command to
     display the contents of the patch file on the screen.

  6. An updated PC-type terminal device driver PCTERM.SYS that
     contains a correction for printing at the terminal using the MOS
     ROUTE LPTn TO TERM command.  When printing from an application
     that caused the screen to scroll during the print, extra
     characters would be sent to the printer.

  7. An updated MOSADM.COM file that corrects a problem that caused an
     error message to display when trying to write to the same COM
     device from more than one task at a time.

  8. An updated MOS System Monitor program (MONITOR.COM).  The new
     program contains a correction for the displayed number of files
     open.  Also, a new /U option is available when loading the
     program for the first time during a session.  Entering MONITOR /U
     will load the program and immediately display the main menu, as
     opposed to having to press CTRL - SPACE to bring up the menu.

  9. An updated MOS.COM file that contains a revised MOS ROUTE LPTn
     command option.  Entering just MOS ROUTE at the system prompt,
     with no operands, will display a list of any printer redirection
     presently set and active on the system.

 10. A new $386.SYS memory management driver that was revised to
     compensate for a known problem in some of the early IBM 386SLC
     microprocessors used in some IBM PS/2 computers.

 11. A more efficient $SERIAL.SYS driver that improves communications
     speed through standard serial ports.  Also, input and output FIFO
     support for 16550A UARTs has been added.  This provides an
     additional increase in serial transmission rates.  Two new
     operands (IF= and OF=) have been added to the end of the
     $SERIAL.SYS command statement to provide this support, as
     follows:

          DEVICE={d:\path\}$SERIAL.SYS  /AD=nnnn,IB=nnnnn,
          OB=nnnnn,HS={N,D,X,P,R},IN=n,IF=nn,OF=nn/...

     where:

     IF=nn is the Input FIFO buffer size in bytes. Defaults to 0 -
     disabled. (Can ONLY be used on serial ports using a 16550A UART.
     For such ports, set to 14.)

     OF=nn is the Output FIFO buffer size in bytes. Defaults to 0 -
     disabled. (Can ONLY be used on serial ports using a 16550A UART.
     For such ports, set to 16.)

 12. A new SERINFO utility program that can be used to see what
     serial communication ports are in use on your system and what
     optional parameters are set for each port.  To run the utility,
     enter the following command at the system prompt:

          SERINFO

 13. An updated EXPORT.EXE backup program that contains a new command
     line operand and corrections for appending an export to an
     existing EXPORT diskette set and for importing large export files
     that span multiple diskettes.

     New /f Operand:
 
     A new /f operand is available that selects an alternate behavior
     for the /s copy all subdirectories operand, as follows:

          EXPORT C:\ A: /S

     The above command will export all files in the root and all files
     in all subdirectories.

          EXPORT C:\STUFF A: /S

     The above command will export all files within C:\STUFF
     (presuming that STUFF is a directory rather than a file) and all
     files in all child directories.

          EXPORT C:\STUFF\M*.* A: /S

     The above command will export all files within the C:\STUFF
     directory that start with the letter "m".  It will also find
     every subdirectory within C:\STUFF whose name starts with an "m"
     and then export all files within those subdirectories and their
     child directories.

          EXPORT C:\STUFF\M*.* A: /S /F

     The above command will export all files within the C:\STUFF
     directory that start with the letter "m".  It will also find
     every subdirectory within C:\STUFF and then export only those
     files within those subdirectories and their child directories
     that start with the letter "m".

          NOTE:  The /f switch cannot be used without the /s switch.

     /a APPEND Operand:

     The EXPORT append operation has been corrected to properly
     identify the last diskette of an existing backup set.  If an
     attempt is made to start an append operation with a diskette
     other than the last diskette of an existing backup set, an error
     message will be displayed.  You will have to start the EXPORT
     append operation over again with the correct diskette in the
     drive.

     The first diskette used in an append operation (the last diskette
     of the current backup set) will not be cleared of existing data,
     but appended to.  Any subsequent diskettes used will be cleared
     of any existing data and overwritten with the new EXPORT data.

     /d OPERAND, Specified Date:

     The User's Guide says that the /d operand selects files for
     export with dates that come after the specified date.  This is
     not correct.  Files with dates that match or come after the
     specified date will be selected for export.

     EXPORT Files that Span Multiple Diskettes:

     A problem has been corrected in which large exported files that
     spanned more than one diskette could sometimes not be properly
     restored with the IMPORT program.  This was found to be a problem
     in the EXPORT program and is corrected in the EXPORT.EXE provided
     with this update.

 14. A new UNTERM.SYS driver for Video Network Adapter Plus (VNA Plus)
     and Video Graphic Network Adapter Plus (VGNA Plus) hardware that
     fixes problems with printing through the parallel port on
     workstation Interface Units and random workstation lock-ups.

 15. A revised $ARNET.SYS driver for the "SmartPort-8" and "SmartPort
     Plus-16" intelligent multiple serial port boards by ARNET
     Corporation.

 16. Patches that must be manually applied to LANLink 5X and LANLink
     LapTop to provide compatibility with PC-MOS 5.01.  The patch
     files are:

          LL5M.PAT - This patch is REQUIRED for PC-MOS 5.01
                     and LANLink 5X.  The patch is applied
                     to LANSERVE.COM.

          LL5MDEMO.PAT - This patch is REQUIRED for PC-MOS 5.01
                     and LANLink 5X.  The patch is applied
                     to LANSERVE.COM on the LANLink 5X DEMO Disk.

          LL5XSAT.PAT - This patch is REQUIRED for PC-MOS 5.01
                     and LANLink 5X.  The patch is applied to
                     LANSAT.SYS.

          LLLAP5M.PAT - This patch is REQUIRED for PC-MOS 5.01
                     and LANLink LapTop.  The patch is applied
                     to LANSERVE.COM.

          LLLAPSAT.PAT -  This patch is REQUIRED for PC-MOS 5.01
                     and LANLink LapTop.  The patch is applied
                     to LANSAT.SYS.

     The patch files themselves are ASCII text files that contain both
     the patch and the instructions on how to apply the patch.  Use
     the TYPE command to display the contents of the patch file on the
     screen or the COPY command to send it to the printer.  Then
     follow the instructions to apply the patch.

 17. PATCHES FOR PC-MOS:

     These patches ARE AUTOMATICALLY APPLIED to PC-MOS by the INSTALL
     program!

     Patch 2: (Patch 1 is replaced by Patch 2)

     This patch must be applied to the PC-MOS kernel to correct a
     possible incorrect partition boot record entry.  This problem
     primarily occurs if you have a secondary partition formatted
     under PC-MOS 4.10 and then reformat it under PC-MOS 5.01.  This
     will happen when using AutoInstall to upgrade an existing dual
     boot system.  The incorrect partition boot record entry will
     prevent the system from booting from the PC-MOS secondary boot
     partition.  In some cases this may also happen when formatting a
     new secondary partition made with PC-MOS 5.01 HDSETUP.  In that
     case, you will get a "Boot Error" message when attempting to boot
     from the PC-MOS secondary boot partition.

     Patch 3:

     This patch must be applied to the PC-MOS kernel to correct the
     method that PC-MOS uses for terminating the System File Table. 
     This is required for PC-MOS security to function correctly in a
     local area network environment.

     Patch 4:

     This patch must be applied to the PC-MOS kernel to allow
     installation of the Bernoulli 90 MB Pro Series removable
     cartridge system.  Without this patch, the DOSOAD.SYS device
     driver and DOSCFG.EXE configuration program that come with this
     system will not load and run.
