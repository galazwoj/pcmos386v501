                             $$MOSCFG.SYS



This document describes enhancements to the PC-MOS 5.01 Booster
Version 2.00 CONFIG.SYS processing.  If the $$MOSCFG.SYS file is
present in the root directory of the boot drive when PC-MOS boots,
then the CONFIG.SYS processing is enhanced to include boot-time
selection of CONFIG.SYS commands depending upon the hardware
configuration.  CONFIG.SYS processing is also enhanced by adding an
ECHO command to display messages for debugging and status as
$$MOSCFG.SYS processes CONFIG.SYS.  If $$MOSCFG.SYS is not present in
the root directory of the boot drive, then the CONFIG.SYS processing
is not enhanced.



The ECHO statement is:

ECHO <string> [ ... <string> ]

where <string> is a single-quoted or double-quoted string.  The
single quote character can't occur in a single-quoted string and the
double quote character can't occur in a double-quoted string. The
ECHO statement displays <string> to the boot console.  One or many
strings may be specified.



The boot-time selection of CONFIG.SYS commands is implemented using
IF statements.  An IF statement is:

IF <condition>
;...
;CONFIG.SYS commands processed if IF <condition> is true.
;...
ELSEIF <condition>
;...
;CONFIG.SYS commands processed if IF <condition> is false and
;ELSEIF <condition> is true.  Any number or no ELSEIF statements can
;occur between the IF statement and the optional ELSE statement or
;ENDIF statement.
;...
ELSE
;...
;CONFIG.SYS commands processed if last preceding ELSEIF <condition>
;is false or, if no ELSEIF, if IF <condition> is false.  One or no
;ELSE statements can occur between the last preceding ELSEIF
;statement (or IF statement) and the ENDIF statement.
;...
ENDIF



<condition>'s can be OR'ed, AND'ed and NOT'ed as:

NOT <condition1> AND <condition2> OR <condition3> AND NOT <condition4>

Operator precedence is OR (lowest), AND, NOT (highest) so the above
is true if <condition1> is false and <condition2> is true, else it is
true if <condition3 is true and <condition4> is false.  Parentheses
can be used to alter the operator precedence if needed.

Condition evaluation is short-circuited, that is, in a left-to-right
evaluation of the condition expression according to the operator
precedence above, a <condition> is not evaluated unless it must be. 
Thus, in the above condition example: if <condition1> is TRUE,
<condition2> is not evaluated; if <condition1> is FALSE and
<condition2> is TRUE, then neither <condition3> nor <condition4> is
evaluated, etc.  In the above expression all conditions are evaluated
only if <condition1> is FALSE, <condition2> is TRUE and <condition3>
is TRUE.



<condition>'s include:

CPU <comparison> <cpu value>
VIDEO <comparison> <video value>
MEMORY <comparison> <decimal megabytes base + extended memory>
RAM <hex address>
ROM <hex address>
MATCH <hex address> <byte value(s)>
ASK <prompt string> <optional default answer> <optional time-out>

as described in the following.



CPU <comparison> <cpu value>

<comparison> can be <, >, <>, =, <= or >=.  <cpu value> can be 8086,
80286, 80386, 80486 or PENTIUM.  The result of the condition is true
if the result of comparing the system CPU to the <cpu value> is true
according to the <cpu value> ordering above.  That is, CPU < 80286
only if CPU = 8086 and CPU > 80486 only if CPU = PENTIUM.



VIDEO <comparison> <video value>

<comparison> can be <, >, <>, =, <= or >=.  <video value> can be MDA,
HGC, CGA, MCGA, EGA or VGA.  The result of the condition is true if
the result of comparing the system's active video adapter to the
<video value> is true according to the <video value> ordering above. 
That is VIDEO < CGA is true only if VIDEO = MDA OR VIDEO = HGC (VIDEO
= HGC is true if a Hercules-compatible monochrome adapter is the
active video adapter).  VIDEO > EGA is true only if VIDEO = VGA.



MEMORY <comparison> <decimal megabytes base + extended memory>

<comparison> can be <, >, <>, =, <= or >=.  <decimal megabytes base +
extended memory> can be from 1 to 64.  For CPU >= 80286, the total
memory is determined from the system setup CMOS.  For CPU = 8086, the
condition is always true for <, <= and <>, otherwise the condition is
false.



ROM <hex address>

<hex address> must be from C0000 to EFFFF.  The condition is true if
ROM is detected at <hex address>.  ROM is detected by looking at each
2K address from C0000 through EF800.  When an adapter ROM signature
is detected, and the ROM length includes <hex address>, the condition
is true.



RAM <hex address>

<hex address> can be from 00000 to FFFFF.  A read-write test is
performed to see if RAM is present at the address - thus <hex
address> ordinarily should not be a memory-mapped i/o address.  Note
that it is possible for RAM <hex address> and ROM <hex address> to
both be true for the same <hex address>.  This would occur if shadow
ram were supplied by the system over the ROM and the shadow ram were
not write-protected.



MATCH <hex address> <byte value(s)>

<hex address> can be from 00000 to FFFFF.  <byte value(s)> can be a
list of <hex byte value>'s and <string>'s.  <hex byte value>'s and
<string>'s can occur in the same list.  <hex byte value> can be from
00 to FF.  <string> is a single-quoted string (which can't contain a
single-quote) or is a double-quoted string (which can't contain a
double-quote).  The condition is true if the <byte value(s)> match
the contents of memory starting at the <hex address> memory location.
It is an error for the <byte value(s)> to extend past memory location
FFFFF.



ASK <prompt string> <optional default answer> <optional time-out>

<prompt string> is a single-quoted string (which can't contain a
single-quote) or is a double-quoted string (which can't contain a
double-quote).  <optional default answer> is Y or N. <optional
time-out> is a decimal number from 1 to 3600 seconds.  The prompt
string is displayed followed by " (Y/N)? [x]" where x is the
<optional default answer> if present, otherwise x is a space.  The
condition returns true if the user types Y in response to the
prompt.  The condition returns false if the user types N or Esc in
response to the prompt.  If the user presses Enter, the condition
acts as though the user pressed <optional default answer> (if not
specified, the condition does not return until the user presses Y or
N or Esc).  If <optional time-out> is specified, then <optional
default answer> is required and the condition acts as though the user
pressed <optional default answer> after the number of seconds
specified by <optional time-out>.  If the <optional time-out> is not
specified, then the condition waits for the user to press an
appropriate key.

Note that the <condition> OR and AND short-circuiting especially
applies to the ASK statement.  IF CPU >= 8086 OR ASK ... will never
display the ASK prompt.



Unrecognized <condition>'s:

The entire IF statement is displayed with an error message and "Treat
IF condition as true (Y/N)? [ ]" is displayed on the following line.
The entire IF statement <condition> is regarded as true if the user
types Y.  It is regarded as false if the user types N or Esc.
