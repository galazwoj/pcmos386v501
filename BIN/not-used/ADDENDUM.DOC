     PKZIP, PKUNZIP and PKSFX Version 1.1 includes several new features.
     They are described in this addendum to the PKZIP, PKUNZIP and PKSFX
     Version 1.0 manual.


     PKZIP

     The following new features have been incorporated into the PKZIP
     Version 1.1 software release.

     -3  Disable 80386 instruction usage
     -----------------------------------

          This option is available for users with 80386 type computers.
          It is used to turn OFF the added 80386 instructions or
          registers.  When these instructions are available, PKZIP will
          utilize them to allow the program to function even faster.
          However, if you are running a different program that may
          conflict with use of the 80386 instructions, you can disable
          them by using this command.

          The 80386 instructions will be disabled only for the current
          PKZIP operation.  They will then be enabled immediately after
          the command operation is completed.

          C:\PKWARE> PKZIP FILES.ZIP  -3   -a  *.DOC

          In the above example,  all of the *.DOC files in the current
          directory will be added to the ZIP file, FILES.ZIP.  The 80386
          instructions will be disabled while the command is being
          executed.


          You can also disable the 80386 instructions when you start
          PKZIP by using the PKNO386 environment variable.  To set the
          environment variable, type PKNO386=xxxx, where "xxxx" is any
          string you choose.  If the string PKNO386 is present in the
          environment, then PKZIP (and PKUNZIP) will not use the 80386
          instructions or registers.

          To enable the 80386 instructions after they have been
          disabled, type SET PKNO386=<Enter>, where <Enter> refers to
          the Enter key.


          NOTE:  Disabling the 80386 usage will make PKZIP run up to
                 twenty percent slower than if the 80386 instructions
                 are used.




     PKWARE Version 1.1  Addendum         1



     -^  Echo the command line
     -------------------------

          This command is used to display the PKZIP command that you
          entered on the console.  It is useful for example, when you
          are using the View file option; the file specifications that
          you entered will be echoed on the console along with the
          command output.

          E:\> PKZIP  docs.zip  -vd -^ *.doc

          In this example, technical information about all of the *.doc
          files included in the DOCS.ZIP  ZIP file will be displayed.
          The information will be sorted by date, and the command line
          will be redisplayed on the screen above the output.


     -x@file  Exclude list file
     --------------------------

          This option is used to exclude a List File from the current
          operation.  Recall that a List File is a file containing a
          list of files that are grouped together.  List Files can be
          used with all the PKZIP and PKUNZIP command options.  They are
          always preceded by the @ symbol on the command line.

          This command can be useful when you want to exclude a few
          files from an operation and the DOS wild cards cannot be used
          effectively.

          C:\ACTNG> PKZIP STORE  *.* -x@ACCOUNTS.LIS

          In the above example, all of the files in the current
          directory, except for the List File, ACCOUNTS.LIS, will be
          compressed into the ZIP file STORE.ZIP.


     -$[d]   Save volume label
     -------------------------

          This command is used to save the volume label of a specific
          drive along with the ZIP file.  The default drive is the
          current drive, unless another is specified.  The drive letter
          is not saved in the ZIP file, only the volume label.

          C:\ACCTNG> PKZIP  FILES.TAX  -a -$  *.*

          In the above example, all of the files in the current directory
          will be compressed into the ZIP file, FILES.TAX. They will be
          stored along with the volume label for the C: drive.


     PKWARE Version 1.1  Addendum         2



     -t  ZIP only files with a date equal to or later than specified
     ---------------------------------------------------------------

          With this option, you can specify a date so that only files
          with a date that is equal to or more recent than the date
          specified will be included in the PKZIP operation.  If no date
          is specified, today's date will be used by default.

          When specifying a date, use six digits in the following
          format:  mmddyy.  For example, February 14, l990 will be
          listed:  -t021490.  This is true for all computers setup as
          American.  If your computer is setup as European, use the
          following format: ddmmyy.  If your computer is setup as
          Japanese, use the following format:  yymmdd.  If you are not
          sure how your computer is setup, consult your user's manual.

          C:\BACKUP> PKZIP BAKS.ZIP  -t010190

          In this example, all files in the current directory with a
          date later than or equal to January 1, l990 will be compressed
          into the ZIP file, BAKS.ZIP.


     -ei   Implode files only
     ------------------------

          This option is used along with the mini-PKSFX program,
          PKSFXjr.  Only files that have been imploded can be extracted
          with PKSFXjr.  Shrunk files cannot be extracted.  In order to
          create a PKSFXjr.EXE file, this option must be used.

          E:\BATS> PKZIP  EXT.ZIP  -ei

          In this example, all of the files in the current directory
          will be compressed into the ZIP file, EXT.ZIP.  All of the
          files will be imploded.


     PKZIP Configuration File
     ------------------------

          The PKZIP Configuration file can be used to set parameters to
          values other than the normal default values.  There are three
          additional Configuration file options available.  They are
          explained on the following page.







     PKWARE Version 1.1  Addendum         3



          SHRINK > nnnnn
          Where nnnn is some number specifying that files that are
          greater than this number are to be Shrunk.  This option is
          used to save time when you are compressing large files.
          Typically, large files take longer to compress when the
          imploding method is used.

          LISTCHAR=
          This option is used to designate a special character to be used
          to indicate a List file.  By default the  @ character is used,
          as in @FILE.  If you want to use  @ as the first character in a
          file name, you can designate an alternate character to be used
          to indicate List files.  For example, you could use the # or
          the % characters.

          OPTIONCHAR=
          This option is used to designate a special character to be
          used to indicate a command on the command line.  By default,
          the minus sign  - is used.  If you want to use the minus sign
          as the first character in a file name, you can designate an
          alternate character to be used to indicate a command.  For
          example, you could use the / character.


          Also, PKZIP 1.1 will now search for the Configuration file in
          the following order:

          1.  In the current directory.
          2.  In the path specified by the PKZIP.CFG=  environment
              variable.
          3.  In the path where PKZIP was started from, if DOS version
              greater than or equal to 3.x is being used.


     Additional Error Code
     ---------------------

          There is an additional error code available with PKZIP version
          1.1.  PKZIP will exit with an errorlevel of 18 when it is
          unable to open one or more specified files.  It should be noted
          that this is a "warning" condition only,  and otherwise PKZIP
          was able to construct the ZIP file without any errors.


     NOTE:  There is no longer a 3900 file limit with PKZIP.  The total
            number of files that can be processed is limited only by the
            memory available in the system you are using.  Approximately
            8000 files can be compressed in a ZIP file with 500K+ of
            memory free.



     PKWARE Version 1.1  Addendum         4



     Authenticity Verification
     -------------------------

      -!  Encrypt authenticity verifiable data into the .ZIP file.

          This feature allows you to create ZIP files that PKUNZIP or
          PKSFX can test for authenticity while extracting, providing for
          detection of tampered, hacked, or virus infected files.

          To use this feature, you need to be a registered user of the
          software, and mail the form AUTHVERI.FRM to PKWARE.  PKWARE
          will then send you a postcard listing your name or the name of
          your company, and a unique serial number.

          You must then use the PUTAV.EXE program included with the
          PKWARE program files to install this information.  To do this,
          use the following steps.

          Step 1.  Type PUTAV.  Make sure that PKZIP.EXE is also in the
                   current directory when you do this.  The program will
                   then prompt you to enter your company name.

          Step 2.  Enter your name or the name of the company the
                   software is registered to.  Enter it the same as it
                   appears on the postcard that PKWARE sent.  Press the
                   Enter key when you are done.

          Step 3.  Enter the serial number at the prompt.  Then press
                   the Enter key.

          After successfully completing the above steps, "Serial number
          installation complete" will appear on the screen.  Your name
          and unique serial number will then be encrypted in the program.

          To use this option, include -! on the PKZIP command line. When
          you then extract or test a file using PKUNZIP, it will
          automatically be verified for authenticity.  An example is
          shown below.

          D:\> PKZIP -! ALL.ZIP *.*

          In this example, all of the files in the current directory
          will be ZIPPED into a file called ALL.ZIP, and they will
          include the Verify Authenticity option.  When this file is
          UNZIPPED using PKUNZIP, a message will appear stating the
          authenticity has been checked.

    NOTE: The authenticity verification feature is available in the
	  U.S.A. and Canada only.  File encryption and authenticity
	  verification is not available in export versions of the software.


     PKWARE Version 1.1  Addendum         5



     PKUNZIP

     The following new features have been incorporated into the PKUNZIP
     Version 1.1 software release.


     -3  Disable 80386 instruction usage
     -----------------------------------

          This option is available for users with 80386 type computers.
          It is used to turn OFF the added 80386 instructions or
          registers.  When these instructions are available, PKUNZIP
          will utilize them to allow the program to function even
          faster.  However, if you are running a different program that
          may conflict with the use of the 80386 instructions, you can
          disable them by using this command.

          The 80386 instructions will be disabled only for the current
          PKUNZIP operation.  They will be enabled immediately after the
          command operation is completed.


          C:\PKWARE> PKUNZIP -3 COMP.ZIP  DAT*.*

          In the above example,  all of the DAT*.* files in the ZIP file
          COMP.ZIP will be extracted.  The 80386 instructions will be
          disabled while the command is being executed.


          You can also disable the 80386 instructions when you start
          PKUNZIP by using the PKNO386 environment variable.  To set the
          environment variable, type PKNO386=xxxx, where "xxxx" is any
          string you choose.  If the string PKNO386 is present in the
          environment, then PKUNZIP will not use the 80386 instructions
          or registers.

          To enable the 80386 instructions after they have been
          disabled, type SET PKNO386=<Enter>, where <Enter> refers to
          the Enter key.

          NOTE:  Disabling the 80386 usage will make PKUNZIP run up to
                 forty percent slower than if the 80386 instructions are
                 used.









     PKWARE Version 1.1  Addendum         6



     -^  Echo the command line
     -------------------------

          This command is used to display the PKUNZIP command that you
          entered on the console.  It is useful for example, when you are
          using the View file option.  It allows the file specifications
          that you entered to be echoed on the screen along with the
          command output.

          E:\> PKUNZIP  -^ -vn  MAY.ZIP

          In this example, technical information about all of the files
          included in the MAY.ZIP  ZIP file will be displayed.  The
          information will be sorted by name in ascending order, and the
          command line will be redisplayed on the screen above the
          output.


     -$   Restore volume label
     -------------------------

          This command is used to restore any volume label that has been
          stored in the ZIP file.  It is important to remember that the
          PKZIP command used to save a volume label does not store a
          drive letter along with the label.  Upon extraction, the
          volume label will be assigned to the extract drive.

          C:\> PKUNZIP  stuff  -$ d:\misc

          In the above example, all of the files STUFF.ZIP will be
          extracted to the D:\MISC\ directory, and the volume label for
          drive D: will be reset to the one contained in STUFf.ZIP.


     -f   Freshen files in extract directory
     ---------------------------------------

          This function is the inverse of the Freshen option in PKZIP.
          When this option is used, files will be extracted from the ZIP
          file if and only if:

          a)  the files already exist in the target extract directory,
          AND
          b)  the files in the ZIP file are newer then the files in the
              extract directory.

          D:\MISC> PKUNZIP -f  files.zip  a:

          In this example, only those files that meet both of the above
          criteria will be extracted to the A: drive.


     PKWARE Version 1.1  Addendum         7



     -x or -e[c,d,e,n,p,s]  Extract files in designated order
     --------------------------------------------------------

          The above option is used to specify a particular order in
          which to extract files from a ZIP file.  These options are
          used along with  -x or -e, the default PKUNZIP extract option.
          All of the options are defined below.

          -xc or -ec   Extract files in order of CRC value
          -xd or -ed   Extract files in order of date
          -xe or -ee   Extract files in alphabetical order by extension
          -xn or -en   Extract files in alphabetical order by file name
          -xp or -ep   Extract files in order of percentage (ratio) of
                       compression
          -xs or -es   Extract files in order by size


          NOTE:  Future versions of PKUNZIP will only support the -e
                 option and support of the -x option will be discontinued
                 in future versions of PKUNZIP.

          C:\ZIPS>  PKUNZIP  -en -cm  keep.zip

          In this example, all of the files in KEEP.ZIP will be
          extracted to the monitor in alphabetical order.


     ZIP2EXE

          ZIP2EXE no longer requires external PKSFX.PRG files.  There are
          new command line features available with version 1.1 of the
          ZIP2EXE program.  The features available depend on whether you
          are using the MS-DOS or OS/2 versions of the sofware.

          ZIP2EXE  MS-DOS version   -j    Use PKFSXjr program
          ZIP2EXE  OS/2 version     -f    Use PKSFX family mode program


          ZIP2EXE -j   Use the PKSFXjr program

          This option is available only if you have the MS-DOS software
          version.  If the -j option is specified, the mini version,
          PKSFXjr, will be used.  For details on this option, see the
          section on PKSFXjr on page 10.  If this option is not
          specified, the ZIP2EXE program will utilize the standard PKSFX
          program.






     PKWARE Version 1.1  Addendum         8



          ZIP2EXE -f  Create family mode self-extracting file

          This option is used when you are using the OS/2 software
          version.  It specifies that an OS/2 family mode .EXE file is to
          be created, which will run under OS/2 and MS-DOS. If this
          option is not included on the command line, the software will
          create an OS/2 protected mode .EXE file.



     PKSFX  -s<password>   Support password decryption
     -------------------------------------------------

          PKSFX now supports the -s<password> decryption option.  This
          option functions the same as with the PKUNZIP option.  When
          unzipping a ZIP file, including a self-extracting ZIP file,
          that has been encrypted, the files cannot be extracted unless
          the correct password is specified on the command line.

          When specifying the password, there is no space between the s
          and the password.  Also, the password is case sensitive.
          Recall, it is important that you remember or somehow record
          the passwords that you use, because PKWARE does not retain a
          record of these passwords anywhere.

          D:\> a:files -sCode b:

          In the above example, the self-extracting ZIP file, FILES.EXE,
          will be extracted to the B: drive if the correct password for
          the file is Code.



     PKSFX   Confirm before extracting files
     ---------------------------------------

          If the ZIP comment for a file contains a Ctrl-S (0x13), PKSFX
          will display the ZIP comment followed by this statement: "Do
          you want to extract these files now (y/n)?"

          After viewing the ZIP comment, you can decide if you actually
          want to extract these particular files.  Press Y to extract the
          files.  Press N to abort the PKSFX process.  If the process is
          aborted, PKSFX will exit with with an ErrorLevel of 12.

          The Ctrl-S character string will not be displayed in the ZIP
          comment.





     PKWARE Version 1.1  Addendum         9



     PKSFXjr
     -------

          This is a mini-PKSFX program.  You can create a self-
          extracting ZIP file with it by using the -j option on the
          command line when running the ZIP2EXE version 1.1 program.  An
          example is shown below.

          C:\MISC> ZIP2EXE  -j  miscfile.zip


          PKSFXjr includes the following features.

          - PKSFXjr is only 2936 bytes in size.

          - PKSFXjr also supports the comment pausing feature added to
            the standard PKSFX program.  For details on this feature, see
            the explanation above.

          - PKSFXjr will extract all of the files in the self-extracting
            ZIP file.  Individual file names cannot be specified.

          - The only PKUNZIP command line option supported by PKSFXjr is
            the  -o Overwrite option.

          - A maximum of approximately 500 files can be contained within
            a PKSFXjr.EXE file.  However, there is no limit on the
            overall size of the .EXE file that can be created with
            PKSFXjr.

          - PKSFXjr only supports the Exploding of files.  Files that
            have been compressed using the Shrinking method will not be
            extracted.  In order to create a PKSFXjr.EXE file, the -ei
            Implode only option of PKZIP must be used.

          - PKSFXjr requires only about 32K of memory to run.

          - PKSFXjr has the following ErrorLevel exit codes:

            1.  Warning error (failed CRC etc.)
            2.  Can't find .EXE file
            3.  Error in .EXE file
            4.  File has a bad table
            5.  Can't create file
            6.  Disk full
            7.  Too many files
            8.  User aborted at comment pausing
